# Vesting Cliff Drip Stream

[![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-90%25-green?logo=rust)](docs/coverage/html/index.html)

A production-ready Soroban smart contract that combines a **time-locked cliff** with **linear token streaming** for long-term contributor retention on the Stellar network.

## Concept

Standard Drips streams begin releasing tokens immediately. This contract adds a mandatory **[cliff](docs/glossary.md#cliff) period** before any tokens can be claimed, ensuring contributors remain aligned with the project before unlocking value.

For the formal lifecycle model, transition table, and error-to-state mapping, see [docs/flows.md](docs/flows.md).

```
Token Flow
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ledger:   start_ledger      cliff_ledger                  end_ledger
               │                 │                              │
Tokens:        │   [locked]      │  ← instant catch-up claim → │ ← linear drip ──┤
               │                 │                              │
```

1. [Sponsor](docs/glossary.md#sponsor) deposits the **full allocation** upfront into the contract vault.
2. Recipient cannot claim anything until `cliff_ledger` is reached.
3. At the cliff, all tokens accrued since `start_ledger` are **released instantly**.
4. Remaining tokens continue to **drip linearly per [ledger](docs/glossary.md#ledger)** until `end_ledger`.

## Security

## Infrastructure Operations

Terraform-managed AWS infrastructure (ECS, RDS, VPC, IAM). Configuration lives in [`terraform/`](terraform/).

### Drift Detection

A [scheduled GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/drift-detection.yml) runs
`terraform plan -detailed-exitcode` daily at **02:00 UTC** against the selected
environment's remote state, authenticating to AWS with OIDC (no static access keys).
`workflow_dispatch` allows an on-demand run against `staging` or `production`. The
outcome is classified as clean, drift, or error:

1. **Drift** — one workflow-managed issue (labels `infrastructure` + `drift`) is created
   or updated in place with the plan excerpt and a link to the full plan artifact, and
   Slack `#ops` is alerted with the plan summary.
2. **Clean** — workflow-managed drift issues are commented on and closed; manually
   opened issues are never touched.
3. **Error** — the run fails, open drift issues stay open, and Slack `#ops` is alerted.

### Remote State

State lives in a per-environment S3 bucket with DynamoDB locking, AES-256 encryption,
versioning, public access blocked, and MFA delete. Setup, backend migration, stale-lock
handling, and state recovery are documented in
[Terraform Bootstrap](docs/runbooks/terraform-bootstrap.md).

## Contract API

### `create_vesting_stream`

```rust
pub fn create_vesting_stream(
    env: Env,
    sponsor: Address,     // must sign; pays the deposit
    recipient: Address,   // beneficiary
    token: Address,       // SAC token contract
    rate: i128,           // tokens per ledger (> 0)
    cliff_duration: u32,  // ledgers until cliff
    total_duration: u32,  // total stream length (> cliff_duration)
) -> Result<u32, VestingError> // newly allocated stream_id
```

Stream IDs start at `0` for new recipients and increase per recipient. Existing deployments read their legacy single schedule as stream ID `0`; newly created streams receive subsequent IDs. Validates that `rate × total_duration ≥ min_deposit` (configurable, default 100).

`cliff_duration` must be at least `1`; a zero-length cliff is rejected with
`InvalidCliffDuration` (code 12) because it provides no lockup guarantee.

### `claim_vested`

```rust
pub fn claim_vested(
    env: Env,
    recipient: Address,
    stream_id: Option<u32>, // None claims all active streams
) -> Result<i128, VestingError>
```

Returns the total amount transferred across the selected stream(s). Streams use their own token; pass `Some(stream_id)` to claim one stream or `None` to claim all claimable streams.

### `cancel_stream`

```rust
pub fn cancel_stream(
    env: Env,
    sponsor: Address,
    recipient: Address,
    stream_id: u32,
) -> Result<(), VestingError>
```

Cancels the stream. If the cliff has passed, the recipient keeps accrued tokens; the sponsor receives the remainder. If the cliff has not passed, the full deposit is refunded to the sponsor.

### `clawback_stream`

```rust
pub fn clawback_stream(
    env: Env,
    sponsor: Address,    // original stream funder; must sign
    recipient: Address,
    stream_id: u32,
    reason: String,      // compliance reason (max 256 chars)
) -> Result<(), VestingError>
```

Compliance clawback: the original sponsor recovers **all remaining tokens** in the vault, bypassing cliff state. Only available on tokens that support the SAC clawback flag. Emits `StreamClawedBack` event with the reason string.

### `drain_expired_stream`

```rust
pub fn drain_expired_stream(
    env: Env,
    caller: Address,     // any address; no auth required
    recipient: Address,
) -> Result<(), VestingError>
```

Permissionless cleanup of a fully expired stream. Available to any caller after `end_ledger + 6,307,200` ledgers (~1 year) have elapsed. Transfers remaining tokens to the original sponsor. Emits `StreamDrained` event.

### `set_min_deposit`

```rust
pub fn set_min_deposit(
    env: Env,
    admin: Address,     // must sign
    min_deposit: i128,  // new minimum total deposit (must be > 0)
) -> Result<(), VestingError>
```

Updates the minimum total deposit threshold in instance storage. Default is 100 tokens.

### View functions

| Function | Returns |
|---|---|
| `get_schedule(recipient)` | `Option<VestingSchedule>` |
| `get_stream_ids(recipient)` | `Vec<u32>` — active stream IDs in ascending order |
| `get_schedule_by_id(recipient, stream_id)` | `Option<VestingSchedule>` |
| `claimable_amount(recipient)` | `i128` — `0` if cliff not reached |
| `get_claimable_batch(recipients)` | `Vec<(Address, i128)>` — preserves input order; unknown recipients return `0` |
| `is_cliff_passed(recipient)` | `bool` |
| `get_min_deposit()` | `i128` — current minimum deposit threshold |

| 21 | `Unauthorized` | Caller is not the contract admin or original sponsor |
| 22 | `DepositBelowMinimum` | Overflow check passed but `rate × total_duration < min_deposit`; total deposit is below the configured minimum |
| 23 | `StreamAlreadyPaused` | Stream is already paused |
| 24 | `StreamNotPaused` | `resume_stream` called on a non-paused stream |
| 25 | `VersionOverflow` | Version counter has reached `u32::MAX` |
| 26 | `ClawbackNotSupported` | Token does not support the SAC clawback flag |
| 27 | `InvalidToken` | `token` is not a valid SAC; the `try_balance` probe failed |
| 27 | `InvalidToken` | Token address is not a valid SAC contract |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
- [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools/cli/install-cli) (`stellar`)

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### Build

```bash
make build
```

### Test

```bash
make test
```

CI also runs the contract test suite through Soroban's WASM runner so the
contract is exercised in the same target it is deployed to.

### Deploy to Testnet

```bash
stellar keys generate default --network testnet --fund
./scripts/deploy.sh default
```

### Invoke

```bash
export VESTING_CONTRACT=<contract-id>
export SPONSOR=default
export RECIPIENT=<G...>
export TOKEN=<C...>
export RATE=10
export CLIFF_DURATION=17280   # ~1 day at 5s/ledger
export TOTAL_DURATION=172800  # ~10 days

./scripts/invoke_create.sh
```

## Security Considerations

- **Auth**: Both `create_vesting_stream` ([sponsor](docs/glossary.md#sponsor)) and `claim_vested` / `cancel_stream` (respective callers) use [`require_auth()`](docs/glossary.md#auth--require_auth).
- **Same-address guard**: `create_vesting_stream` rejects calls where `sponsor == recipient`, returning `InvalidRecipient` (error 11) immediately before any token transfer. This prevents a sponsor from vesting tokens to themselves and bypassing the cliff lock.
- **Overflow protection**: All arithmetic uses [checked_* operations](docs/glossary.md#checked-arithmetic), returning `DepositOverflow` on failure.
- **Overflow boundary**: The maximum valid deposit rate for a given duration is `i128::MAX / total_duration`; one unit above that returns `DepositOverflow`.
- **Multiple streams**: Each recipient can have concurrent streams, identified by an auto-incremented `stream_id`.
- **TTL management**: [Persistent storage](docs/glossary.md#persistent-storage) entries are bumped on every read/write (~60-day window) to prevent expiry of active streams.
- **No admin backdoor**: The contract has no owner/admin key; only the original sponsor can cancel.
